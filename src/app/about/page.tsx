          Welcome to &apos;Petty&apos;â€”your beloved pixelated Tamagotchi
          adventure!
        </h4>
        <p>
          Choose your pet&apos;s skin, name it, and plunge into a world of care.
          Watch as your friend loses happiness, fullness, and thirst every few
          seconds. Your role? Keep them fed, watered, and lovedâ€”but beware, it
          costs coins!
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay alert for endearing notifications indicating hunger, happiness,
          affection, or even the call of nature. Want more coins to buy
          something for your pet? Find a job... just kidding! ðŸ˜„
        </p>
        <p>
          Interact by petting, feeding, and hydrating your companion, and revel
          in the joyful jumps with every action. Keep an eye on its urine level;
          when it hits 50, take your pet for a stroll to spread the love and
          earn coins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get ready to embark on a pixelated journey filled with care, joy, and
          endless funâ€”because with &apos;Petty&apos; every click brings you
          closer to a happier pet!
